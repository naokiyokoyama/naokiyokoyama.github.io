						<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition</h3>
						<br>
						<p class="fontsize">
							The activity that I was most passionate about in my four years of high school was the FIRST Robotics Competition. In an exhilarating six weeks our team would build a large robot to compete in sports-type matches. I functioned mainly as an engineer, contributing to many of the mechanisms put on the robots each year. My participation in FIRST gave me the fondest experiences with collaborating in a team, leading projects, machining, designing, and simply building, as well as some of my closest friends. During my senior year I had the fortune of being the Human Player, winning the 2013 New York Regional as a part of the drive team during the regional's final year.
